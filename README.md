# Source2Course

This project aims to provide tools that aid in creating course materials for
programming courses directly from source files.

The idea is to use comments in source files in order to describe tasks, examples etc.
Similar to tools like JavaDoc or Doxygen, these comments can then be automatically
evaluated to create e.g. pdfs, slides, or exams.

The project will be written in Go and it also targets source files for the
Go programming language. Other languages may follow.
Additionally, the project will make use of LaTeX.
